The will_paginate plugin - With the addition of pagination, you will need to add Mislav's will_paginate plugin to your vendor/plugins directory.  See http://github.com/mislav/will_paginate/tree/master

To install this plugin, from extension root:
<pre>
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
</pre>

h2. Installation

From your RADIANT_ROOT:

<pre>
$ script/extension install page_list_view

Restart your radiant app, and you should be good to go.

NOTE:  This _should_ add the submodules described above in requirements, but if not follow the directions indicated.
